/**
 * Custom behaviour for rooms for files.
 *
 * The rooms for files are intended to give the users a way to talk about a
 * specific shared file, for example, when collaboratively editing it. The room
 * is persistent and can be accessed simultaneously by any user or guest if the
 * file is publicly shared (link share, for example), or by any user with direct
 * access (user, group, circle and room share, but not link share, for example)
 * to that file (or to an ancestor). The room has no owner, although self joined
 * users with direct access become persistent participants automatically when
 * they join until they explicitly leave or no longer have access to the file.
 *
 * These rooms are associated to a "file" object, and their custom behaviour is
 * provided by calling the methods of this class as a response to different room
 * events.
