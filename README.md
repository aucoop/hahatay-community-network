# Hahatay Network

## About

[Hahhatay](https://hahatay.org) is a non-profit organization for community development, aimed at providing effective responses to forced migrations in Africa that deprive its youth of hope. The organization's objective is to empower and involve young people to become true protagonists in improving their lives, and to be a meeting space that connects individuals committed to integral human development.

## Network Implementation

Hahatay created a local network using six airMAX antennas, routers, hubs, switches, and two servers. The network connects four locations: Aminata (the cultural center), Defaratt (the recycling center), Sunu Keur (the residence), and Tabax Nit√© (the educational village). One server manages network traffic, hosts services and software to improve daily workflow, and the other server is exclusively dedicated to multimedia tasks.

In 2022, Hahatay added new access points and formed a mesh network to improve Wi-Fi access and implemented new local services. These included shared folders for workers with remote backup, online video and audio playback services, and an improved Nextcloud platform. Collaborating corporate entities donated servers for these services, including Labdoo and Typeform, which include: 

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com): a cloud solution similar to Google Cloud, for uploading and sharing documents.

[Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/): a Nextcloud solution to chat with your peers and make voice and video calls.

A NAS with [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org): combined with backups in different buildings for disaster recovery.

[Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org): streaming services for multimedia consumption.

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/): reverse proxy for deploying multiple microservices.

[Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/): for docker management.

[PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/): our Intranet DNS.

[SpeedTest](https://www.speedtest.net/): for internet-intranet speed testing.

The purpose of this repository is to detail the process followed in the implementation of this infrastructure in hopes of encouraging more people from the tech community to embrace self-hosted projects and target other rural areas around Africa.
